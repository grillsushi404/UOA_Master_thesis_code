*** Key research questions ***

* How effective are static, area-based marine protected areas (MPAs) in protecting large migratory southern right whales (SRWs) during their key breeding season?
* Are SRWs' main calving habitats in southern NZ vulnerable to vessel traffic? If so, which areas should be prioritized based on vessel movement and whale habitat use patterns?

*** Key findings  ***

* two previously unknown and currently unprotected areas that are heavily used by whales based on behavior estimates.
* High spatiotemporal overlap between whales and vessels within several MPAs during the peak breeding period (June to October).
* Shifting risk profile in the opportunities of whales-vessels encounters based on location and timing of the months. 

*** Implications***
* How can we evaluate/optimize MPAs for migratory marine mammals, especially in the era of climate change.
* Vessel traffic poses substantial threats to whales. What can be done to lower such risks? (e.g., near real-time whale detection warning system so vessel operators can respond accordingly)
